Beginner Level Problem Statement: 
Managing C++ Files and Directories in Linux

`Objective`:  
Gain hands-on experience 
with basic Linux commands while working 
with a C++ project by 
    creating, 
    editing, 
    compiling, and 
    running simple programs.

---

`Tasks`:

1. Create a new directory called `my_cpp_project` for your C++ programs.
2. Change into the `my_cpp_project` directory.
3. Create a C++ file named `greet.cpp` 
in the `my_cpp_project` directory.
4. Write a C++ program inside `greet.cpp` 
that asks the user for their name and prints a greeting message.
5. Compile the `greet.cpp` program into an executable.
6. Run the compiled executable and ensure 
that it prompts for the user’s name and displays the greeting.
7. Use a Linux command to display the contents of `greet.cpp`.
8. Modify the `greet.cpp` file 
to add a simple farewell message and save the changes.
9. Compile and run the modified program 
to ensure it works as expected.
10. Remove the `greet.cpp` file once you're done.
11. Check the contents of the `my_cpp_project` directory, and 
remove the directory if it’s empty.

`Goal`:  
Through this task, you'll practice 
using basic Linux commands such as 
    directory creation, 
    text file manipulation, 
    compiling, and 
    running programs, 
helping you become more familiar 
with the Linux environment for C++ development.
