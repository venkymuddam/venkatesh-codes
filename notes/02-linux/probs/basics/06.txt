Beginner Level Problem Statement: 
Working with `vi` Editor 
to Create and Modify a C++ Program

`Objective`:  
Gain familiarity with the `vi` editor 
by creating, editing, and managing a C++ program 
that performs basic input and output operations. 
This will help you practice file manipulation and 
editing using `vi`.

---

`Tasks`:

1. `Create a C++ project directory`:
   - Create a directory called `cpp_vi_practice` 
   to store your C++ program files.

2. `Navigate to the project directory`:
   - Use the `cd` command to enter the `cpp_vi_practice` directory.

3. `Create a new C++ file using `vi``:
   - Open the `vi` editor and create a new file named `number_check.cpp`.

4. `Write a basic C++ program`:
   - In the `vi` editor, write a simple C++ program 
   that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
   - Example program:
     ```cpp
     #include <iostream>
     using namespace std;

     int main() {
         int number;
         cout << "Enter a number: ";
         cin >> number;
         if (number > 0)
             cout << "The number is positive." << endl;
         else if (number < 0)
             cout << "The number is negative." << endl;
         else
             cout << "The number is zero." << endl;
         return 0;
     }
     ```

5. `Save and exit the file`:
   - After writing the program, save it and 
   exit the `vi` editor using `:wq`.

6. `Edit the program`:
   - Open `number_check.cpp` again in `vi` and 
   modify the program to check 
   if the number is even or odd, 
   in addition to being positive, negative, or zero.

7. `Use `vi` to navigate and edit the file`:
   - Use basic `vi` navigation and editing commands like `i` (insert), 
   `x` (delete character), `dd` (delete line), 
   `:w` (save), and `:q` (quit) to update the code.
   
8. `Compile the C++ program`:
   - After saving the changes, 
   compile the program using `g++` 
   to generate an executable named `number_check`.

9. `Run the compiled program`:
   - Run the program to verify 
   that it correctly checks 
   whether the number is positive, negative, or zero, and 
   also checks if it is even or odd.

10. `View the contents of the file`:
    - Use the `cat` command to display the contents of `number_check.cpp`.

11. `Delete the program file`:
    - Once done testing the program, 
    remove the `number_check.cpp` file using the `rm` command.

12. `Delete the project directory`:
    - Check if the `cpp_vi_practice` directory is empty, and 
    remove it if it is.

`Goal`:  
By completing this task, you will practice using the `vi` editor 
to create and modify C++ programs, navigate within a file, and 
apply Linux commands for compiling and running C++ programs. 
This will enhance your familiarity with both programming and 
working in a Linux environment.
