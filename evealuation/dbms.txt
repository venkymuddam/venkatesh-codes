I have an UNF table
tickets
booking_id, booking_number, airline_id, airline_name,
customer_id, customer_name, customer_city,
flight_number, flight_date, departure_time, arrival_time,
departure_city, arrival_city, ticket_price, seat_class,
seat1_number, seat1_price,
seat2_number, seat2_price,
seat3_number, seat3_price,
meal1_item_id, meal1_item_name, meal1_price, meal1_qty, meal1_amount,
meal2_item_id, meal2_item_name, meal2_price, meal2_qty, meal2_amount,
meal3_item_id, meal3_item_name, meal3_price, meal3_qty, meal3_amount

I formed the below NF tables:
customer: customer_id, customer_name, customer_city
airline: airline_id, airline_name
seat: seat_id, seat_number, seat_price
meal: meal_id, meal_name, price

booking: booking_id, booking_number, flight_number, flight_date,  
    departure_time, arrival_time, departure_city, arrival_city,  
    ticket_price, seat_class, customer_id, airline_id  
booking_meal: meal_id, meal_name, price, quantity, amount, booking_id  
booking_seat: seat_id, seat_number, price, booking_id  

My data is going to be:
I am Aravind, and I have booked tickets for my family from Chennai to Delhi on flight AI102 operated by Air India.
flight_date: 2024-11-20, departure_time: 10:00 AM, arrival_time: 1:00 PM
seat_class: economy
seat_numbers: [12A, 12B, 12C], each seat price is Rs.5000
meals ordered: [Veg Meal @ Rs.300 x 2, Chicken Meal @ Rs.500 x 1, Coffee @ Rs.100 x 3]
And
I have booked tickets for my parents from Bangalore to Mumbai on flight SG345 operated by SpiceJet.
flight_date: 2024-11-22, departure_time: 5:00 PM, arrival_time: 7:00 PM
seat_class: business
seat_numbers: [1A, 1B], each seat price is Rs.8000
meals ordered: [Veg Meal @ Rs.300 x 1, Chicken Meal @ Rs.500 x 2]

Now, I need the table scripts in Oracle with primary keys, not null, and foreign keys.
I also need insert statements for the tables.
And I need the data in tabular form for all NF tables.

I have booked tickets using my Aadhaar ID.

    I watched Flight AI102 on 20-Nov-2024 at 10:00 AM.
    I watched Flight SG345 on 22-Nov-2024 at 5:00 PM.

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Alter Table Script



ALTER TABLE booking 
ADD (
    show_date_time DATE NOT NULL, 
    aadhaar_id VARCHAR2(12) NOT NULL
);

    The show_date_time column is of type DATE to store the date and time of the show.
    The aadhaar_id column is of type VARCHAR2(12) assuming Aadhaar ID is a 12-digit string.



Step 2: Update Script




UPDATE booking
SET show_date_time = TO_DATE('20-Nov-2024 10:00 AM', 'DD-Mon-YYYY HH:MI AM'),
    aadhaar_id = '123456789012'
WHERE booking_id = 1;  -- Assuming booking_id = 1 for Flight AI102


UPDATE booking
SET show_date_time = TO_DATE('22-Nov-2024 05:00 PM', 'DD-Mon-YYYY HH:MI PM'),
    aadhaar_id = '123456789012'
WHERE booking_id = 2;  -- Assuming booking_id = 2 for Flight SG345

  
    The TO_DATE function is used to convert the date and time string into the DATE format.
    Replace booking_id = 1 and booking_id = 2 with the actual booking_id values in your table.

I have booked tickets for my family. Only 3 tickets for Rubber Ball movie at Star Theatre. [Use the ticket numbers and price from the ticket table].

I also bought two samosas and three pop korn.

Please book this ticket as a single transaction in Oracle with exception handling.

    If data is readable from the master table, read and use it.
    If data is computable, compute and update the table during the transaction.
