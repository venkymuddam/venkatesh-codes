1. what is oracle?
2. how do we design relation database? 
    -- NFs
    -- terms: repeating group, PD, TD
    -- keys : super, candidate, alternate, primary, unique - composite 
3. oracle 21c - "sql developer" vsc extenstion 
    installation 
4. employee - UNF, -> 3NF tables -> denormalized table 
5. Oracle - CRUD operations with employees 
    schema : emp_db (create user | grant | quoto -> tablespace "USERS")
    departments, countries, cities, employees 
        CREATE TABLE 
        INSERT 
        ALTER TABLE employees 
        UPDATE employees 

        denormalized result table using JOINS 
            inner join 
            left outer join 
            right outer join 
            full outer join 
6. SQL - query 
    basic queries for all four tables - 3 tables we did in the class 
        - employees (self leraning)
    filtering (where condition) : IN 
    sorting (order by ASC | DESC)
    aggregators: COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX 
    group by: group based aggregators 

Not covered: 
    DDL:
        CREATE TABLE with foreigh keys, check constraint 
        DROP TABLE, ALTER TABLE, TRUCATE TABLE 
    DML:
        bulk update, DELETE, bulk delete 
    DCL:
        REVOKE 
    TCL:
        rollback, savepoint 
    
    Data types: number, string, boolean, date and time, b/c lob

    Query:  
        selectors : [columns], constant, expression (operators + functions)
            arithmetic operators: 
        filtering: relational operators (=, <>, <=, >=, <, >)
                        LIKE, between, EXISTS, IN 
                        NOT LIKE, NOT BETWEEN, NOT EXISTS, NOT IN 
                logical operators (AND, OR, NOT)
                 
        soring: multi-column 
        group by: multi-column, having (after group giving condition)
        join with group by 
        sub query: [normal sub query], correlated sub query 
        alias names: [column, ] table
    views, stored procedure
